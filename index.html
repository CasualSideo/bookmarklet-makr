<p> Bookmarklets are small JavaScript programs that can be saved as bookmarks and run from the browser's bookmark menu. They are a convenient way to add functionality to the browser or perform actions on the current webpage. Bookmarklets are usually written as a single line of code, and they are launched by clicking on the bookmark in the bookmark menu. Because bookmarklets are JavaScript programs, they can interact with the page and modify its content. They are commonly used to perform tasks such as highlighting text, inserting content, or sending data to a server. Bookmarklets are a simple and easy way to extend the functionality of the browser and make it more powerful and customizable.</p>
